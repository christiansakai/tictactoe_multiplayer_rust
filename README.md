# Tic Tac Toe

A Tic Tac Toe CLI game written in Rust with support for playing over LAN. A toy project for me to learn Rust programming language. Strive to be minimal dependencies (except for things that are too hard of course, like serialization).

Quick Start:

1. Install Rust toolchain
2. `git clone` and `cd tic tac toe`
3. To play:
   - In Hotseat mode, use `cargo run`
   - In LAN mode as the server, `cargo run server`
   - In LAN mode as the client, `cargo run client`
